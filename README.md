# UoPeople-CS-1102-PayRollSystem
Mandatory Programming Project Assignment

The goal of this simple payroll system project is twofold:
a) serve as a case-study and
b) give students the opportunity to connect the dots and implement a full-fledged (albeit simple) application
using most of Object-Oriented Programming.

Understanding this project, by implementing, testing and debugging it,
should provide students with the necessary OOP foundation (classes, information hiding, inheritance and polymorphism)
so widely used in real-world applications nowadays.

At the end of unit 8, you should have a program for a Simple Payroll System in Java that:

路         Keeps a list of employees: Id, Name, Vehicle in the parking lot (if applicable)
路         Enter and save the payroll information: Salary, Bonus, Hourly rate, worked hours
路         Store employee information to an ArrayList.
路         Calculate the payroll
